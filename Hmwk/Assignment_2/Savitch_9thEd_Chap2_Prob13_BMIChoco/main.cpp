 * Problem 13
 * Created: 3/13/2017 20:14
 * Directions: Write a program
that allows the user to input his or her weight in pounds, height in
inches, age in years, and the character M for male and F for female. The
program should then output the number of chocolate bars that should
be consumed to maintain oneâ€™s weight for the appropriate sex of the
specified weight, height, and age.
